== PROJECT: README

== Overview

README is an integrated link manager and web feed aggregator application.

RSS and Atom are common ways of allowing an user to access updates to online content.
When supported by websites, subscribing to the feed removes the need for users to manually check the website in question, offering greater convenience to the user.

== Summary of contributions

=== *Primary enhancement*: I added web syndication(RSS/Atom) support in README.
** Justification: With support for web syndication the user can subscribe to sources of content that they care about, and have the content delivered to them.
** Highlights: This enhancement requires significant architectural changes in the base link management application. It required an in-depth analysis of design considerations.
** Credits: The https://rometools.github.io/rome/[ROME] library is used to the heavy lifting in parsing web feeds.

=== *Minor enhancements*
* I added a counter in status bar showing how many entries are listed, which
is a quality-of-life improvement.
